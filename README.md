# Boss Shooting Game

All game assets and code are located under the `BS/` directory. The root `index.html` simply redirects to `BS/index.html`.


Open `index.html` or navigate directly to `BS/index.html` to play the game.
The start screen features a short video that loops in the background while the
"ゲームスタート" button and title remain in the foreground.

On touch devices, on-screen controls are available for moving left, right and firing.
